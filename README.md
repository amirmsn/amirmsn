👋 Hello there! 
I'm <a href="https://github.com/amirmsn">Amir</a>, a passionate mechanical engineer with a knack for coding. My journey in the world of programming began with languages like Python, PHP, JavaScript, and VB .NET, complementing my expertise in mechanical engineering.

💡 My coding adventure often involves tackling mechanical engineering challenges through automation. I enjoy formulating problems using Python and turning concepts into efficient and elegant solutions. Whether it's optimizing processes, simulating systems, or diving into data analysis, I find joy in the intersection of mechanics and code.

🔧 Proficient in HTML/CSS, I also dabble in web design, creating interfaces that merge functionality with aesthetics. My GitHub is a canvas where you'll find a collection of my small projects, each telling a story of problem-solving and creativity.

🏢 Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.hitachienergy.com/se/sv">Hitachi Energy Sweden AB</a> as a Production Verification Engineer, and you can find out more about me via my <a href="linkedin.com/in/amir-mousavian">LinkedIn</a> profile.

🚀 Join me on this journey where gears meet code, and let's explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of mechanical engineering and programming.

Happy coding! 🛠️
